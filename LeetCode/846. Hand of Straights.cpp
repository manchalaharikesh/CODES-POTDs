// Question: 846. Hand of Straights
// Description: Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

//              Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize, return true if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.
// Approach: 1. In this approach we sort the vector hands. Then we store the frequency of elements into a map.
//              Now we iterate through hands and when we have choosen the first element of a group we take it if and only if its freq is available through map.
//              Then for this choosen initial element of a group we verify if there are groupSize consecutive elements available through freq in map. If not return false after checking all elements return true.
//              For better understanding refer to code / LeetCode-solutions ðŸ˜‚.
