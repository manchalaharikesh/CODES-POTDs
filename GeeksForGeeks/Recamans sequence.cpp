// Question: Recamans sequence
// Description: Given an integer n, return the first n elements of Recamanâ€™s sequence.
//              It is a function with domain and co-domain as whole numbers. It is recursively defined as below:
//              Specifically, let a(n) denote the (n+1)th term. (0 being the 1st term).
//              The rule says:
//              a(0) = 0
//              a(n) = a(n-1) - n, if a(n-1) - n > 0 and is not included in the sequence previously
//                   =  a(n-1) + n otherwise.
// Approach: 1. Code is Self-Explanatory.
